# RoninProjects

Ronin is an [open-source replacement for Photoshop](https://100r.co/site/ronin.html#library) with a focus on programmable editing via a Lisp-like user interface. Ronin was developed by Devine Lu Linvega of the 100 Rabbits art group.

I've used Ronin for the usual day-to-day photo resizing, filtering, cropping. But I've also used Ronin to develop specific utilities such as a user controlled aesthetic color-pallete-maker and a pixelizer.

This repository mostly serves as a staging ground and area where I can have some semblance of version control integrated into these projects.
